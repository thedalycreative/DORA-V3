                            <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
                                <p>Even from a young age, George's path seemed clear. As a toddler, barely two or three years old, she was already embracing the role, playfully donning a nurse's outfit and earning the affectionate nickname, "Nurse Georgina." This early inclination foreshadowed a lifelong passion for caring for others.</p>
                                <p>George pursued her calling with unwavering dedication, attending the University of Cumbria for Health and Social Care from 16-18, before completing her Bachelor of Science in Nursing. She describes her university years as a "bustling hive," where she not only thrived academically but also forged strong bonds with her peers.</p>
                                <p>"I live by my choice, and anyone that knows me will attest to the fact that I'm a nurse not by trade or by job or means of employment, but I'm a nurse by nature," George explains. "Nurse Georgina was fortunate enough to find the job of her dreams, which doesn't happen as often as we all would like – but I am very fortunate that I could study and work in the field I enjoy so much."</p>
                                <p>For many years, George honed her skills working with private clients requiring specialist care and high levels of support. She quickly discovered a natural aptitude for this demanding field. "Being a nurse for a patient with paraplegia and then quadriplegia – I've got the knack for it, or so I'm told," she shares, highlighting her unique ability to connect with and effectively care for those with complex needs.</p>
                                <p>In 2023, George and her husband made the significant move from England to Perth, Western Australia, with their newborn daughter, Thea. The decision was rooted in a desire for Thea to grow up close to family. They instantly fell in love with Perth, settling north of the river. Now, their little one is almost three, and George cherishes the time Thea gets to spend with their British family who have also "migrated across the pond/ditch."</p>
                                <p>It was shortly after their move that George identified a critical gap in Perth's healthcare landscape. "A client I had specialist care for a while now pointed out the gap in healthcare here in Perth," she recalls. "WA seems to have this gap in the market where you can't get a good, decent, reliable, helpful support worker – in fact, you are lucky to get one with experience at all! NDIS funded programs mean there's a lot of resources available out there, and I know how hard it is to get funding."</p>
                                <p>Driven by this observation and her profound commitment to quality care, George founded Dora Healthcare. The company is named after her daughter, Theadora, symbolizing the personal heart and soul poured into its mission. "I am lucky to be both happy and successful with my career," George states, "and my company Dora has got the best healthcare workers that I can find in Perth – myself included."</p>
                                <p>George is excited to continue her journey, showcase the growth of Dora Healthcare, and provide the best possible support to people in Perth.</p>
