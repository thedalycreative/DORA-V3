If you’re reading this, it means I’ve passed away (which is extremely rude of me, I know).  
I’ve written this to make things easier and clearer for the people I love — because I trust you, and I want things to be as simple, loving, and true to me as possible.  
This isn’t a will, just some personal wishes and practical things I want taken care of in the way that feels right to me.


**Digital Legacy**
- **Lisa** is my legacy contact for both Meta (Facebook & Instagram) and iCloud. She has access to anything that needs to be handled digitally — messages, memories, photos, settings, and goodbyes. Please respect her role and back her decisions. She knows what I’d want and I trust her fully.


**Duke the Dog**
- My sweet boy Duke should go to **Dave**, if he's willing. If for any reason Dave can’t take him, **Mum** knows how much he means to me and would give him all the cuddles he deserves.

**My Creative Work & Technology**
- Everything I’ve created – writing, artwork, websites, projects, silly ideas half-finished in a Google Doc – belongs to **Josh and Charlee**. You two know what it means to make something, to laugh at the weird, and to finish what I started. Please keep it safe, use it if it helps, share it if it speaks to someone.

**Possessions**
- I don’t have much, but whatever I do have, sort through it together and take what makes you smile. Donate the rest, and chuck anything that’s crap. No need to hoard my socks.


**Final Wishes**
- Don’t make a fuss.  
- Play music that means something — weird, beautiful, emotional.  
- If there’s a gathering, make it more of a roast-me-while-you-toast-me situation. Keep it funny, real, and full of love.  
- If you speak about me, say what’s true. Even the embarrassing stuff. Especially the embarrassing stuff.


Thanks for loving me and letting me love you.  
Look after each other, make good art, and don’t forget to keep your passwords somewhere safe (lesson learned, I assume).  
With all my heart,  
**Tim**
